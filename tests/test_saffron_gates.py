    Invoked directly rather than through `run_gate`, whose `_gate_env` strips
    Saffron's venv so a gate finds the *operator's* toolchain rather than
    Saffron's. That is right for every target repo and wrong when the target
    repo is Saffron: the stripped venv is then also the repo's own declared
    toolchain, so routing this test through `run_gate` made it assert against
    whichever ruff happened to be on the operator's global PATH — or none.
    (Cells are not involved: `_gate_env` reaches only `LocalExecutor`;
    `CellExecutor` execs through `cell_runtime.exec_`, which takes no env.)
    `tests/test_runner.py` owns the env-handling; this file owns the contract.
