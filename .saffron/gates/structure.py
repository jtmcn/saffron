"""ast-grep scan -> the gate contract.

The rules live in `.saffron/rules/` and encode invariants that were prose in
CLAUDE.md and enforced by nothing: which module may name the cell runtime, which
file may import the Agent SDK, and that a gate's `tool` field is executed rather
than written. Structural rather than textual because every one of those has a
legitimate textual near-miss in the tree — a comment naming apple/container, a
string passing `import claude_agent_sdk` to `python -c` (Appendix G, §2.1, §5.4).
