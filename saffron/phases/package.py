"""PACKAGE — a green cell becomes a branch, a draft PR and a queue line (§5.7).

Host-side, no model, and no cell except the gate-only one part 3 of the spec
describes. It runs after the cell is torn down: the host should not be talking
to the real remote while an untrusted container is alive.

No named remote is ever added to the mirror, and no long-lived ref is created.
`mirror.ensure_mirror` fetches `+refs/*:refs/*` with `--prune`, so any ref left
behind that the local repo does not have is deleted on the next run — including
a branch this module just created.
